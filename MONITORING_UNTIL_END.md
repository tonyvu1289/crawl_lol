# Live Match Monitoring Until End

The live odds monitor has been enhanced to track specific live matches until they completely end, rather than stopping when no games are currently active.

## How It Works

### Previous Behavior (Old)
- Monitor would stop if no live games found at any check
- Would miss matches that pause between games/rounds
- Required manual restart if monitoring ended prematurely

### New Behavior (Enhanced)
- **Tracks specific matches** when monitoring starts
- **Continues monitoring** even when games pause between rounds
- **Only stops** when ALL tracked matches have completely ended
- Shows live odds when games are active
- Shows status updates when games are between rounds

## Usage Examples

### Monitor All Live Matches Until They End
```bash
python3 live_odds_monitor.py --all-games --interval 30
```

### Monitor Specific Game Until Match Series Ends
```bash
python3 live_odds_monitor.py --game 1 --interval 15
```

### Monitor With Custom Interval
```bash
python3 live_odds_monitor.py --all-games --interval 10
```

## Example Output

## Key Features

1. **Match Persistence**: Once monitoring starts, it tracks specific match IDs
2. **Intelligent Status**: Shows different information based on match state
3. **Automatic Completion**: Stops only when matches truly end
4. **Odds Change Detection**: Logs when odds change during live games
5. **Series Awareness**: Understands BO3/BO5 match formats

## Technical Details

The monitor works by:
1. Recording all live match IDs when monitoring starts
2. Filtering subsequent API calls to only show tracked matches
3. Checking if tracked matches are still in the live matches list
4. Ending monitoring only when no tracked matches remain live

This ensures you won't miss any odds changes or match developments, even during breaks between games in a series.
